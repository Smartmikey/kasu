        aboutBody: `Freedom of association is one of the most basic rights enjoyed by humans. It ensures that every individual is free to organise and to form and participate in groups, either formally or informally.`,
        provBody: `Registration should never serve as a tool to control the establishment of organisations, but rather as a tool to provide them with a legal status in jurisdictions that require such a measure.


        Denying registration to NGOs that challenge or criticise the government is a violation of the right to freedom of association which forces civil action underground and delegitimises NGO work. Registration as a form of repression also hinders the formation of an open and pluralistic society, by excluding civil society from public dialogue.
        
        In many countries with a high level of civil society engagement and indeed an enabling environment, prior registration is not mandatory. If such regulations are in place, the UN has underlined that principles guiding the rule of law also apply to these regulations, meaning that they should be determinable, non-retroactive, lawful, proportional, non-discriminatory, and necessary. Furthermore, registration procedures should be expeditious, and not be used as a tool to slow down the establishment of organisations.
        
        The possibility to appeal a decision should be included in the regulation, to provide civil society organisations with fair access to obtaining legal status. Provisions should not require re-registration, enabling organisations to be sustainable and look to the long-term.
        
        Procedures governing the registration of civil society organisations play an important role in the control of civil society space. With this in mind, the power to limit the right to freedom of association must be appropriately framed. States should not impose lengthy, burdensome or overly bureaucratic registration processes, as this would undermine the effective functioning of NGOs.
        
        In some countries, registration applications filed by associations can take up to a month to be considered for approval, while business registration is considered complete the moment the application is filed.
        
        Burdensome re-registration and reporting requirements usually do not meet the criterion of necessity, as they are solely used to control the activities of NGOs. Nor do they follow the principle of non-discrimination, as often more requirements are placed on civil society than on businesses. There are also doubts that such requirements are proportional, given the heavy requirements with regard to the budget of NGOs, in comparison to businesses for example.`,
        limBody: `The implicit First Amendment right of association in the U.S. Constitution has been limited by court rulings. For example, it is illegal in the United States to consider race in the making and enforcement of private contracts other than marriage. This limit on freedom of association results from Section 1981 of Title 42 of the United States Code, as balanced against the
        First Amendment in the 1976 decision of Runyon v. McCrary . [6]
        Governments often require contracts of adhesion with private entities for licensing purposes, such as with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for stock market trading in the 1938 Maloney Act amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . These contracts often bar association with banned members, as can be seen in United States`,

Some people derive pleasure in torturing another but learn today that it is unlawful. Some will even scream publicly that “meeeeehn! That guy don fuck up! I go chop him face. I go chuck him eyes”.
